## What this does?
This repo along with https://github.com/saha-rajdeep/kubernetescode creates a Jenkins pipeline with GitOps to deploy code into a Kubernetes cluster. CI part is done via Jenkins and CD part via ArgoCD (GitOps).
Follow along with my Udemy Kubernetes course lectures (GitOps Chapter) or the Youtube Video - https://youtu.be/o4QG_kqYvHk to understand how this works, detailed setup instructions, with step by step demo. My highest rated Kubernetes EKS discounted Udemy course link in www.cloudwithraj.com

Please refer to the https://github.com/saha-rajdeep/kubernetescode/blob/main/README.md for the instructions on how to use the codes.
